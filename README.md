# test_application

A test application.

## Getting Started
This project displays the text "Hey there!" in the middle of the screen
and after tapping anywhere on the screen a background color changes to a randomly generated color.
***
The function `generateColor()` generates a random color using RGB. For using `Random()`option
it is necessary to import `dart:math` library.
There is also an arrow `IconButton` that navigates a user to another page.
